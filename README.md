Build a Dynamic Agency Website Prototype with Modern Technologies

As a coding student passionate about frontend development, I'm thrilled to present my interactive agency website prototype. This project serves as a platform to showcase my proficiency in:

Modern Web Development: Constructing clean, semantic code using HTML5 and CSS3, while adhering to best practices and implementing modern design principles.

Interactive Features with JavaScript: Leveraging JavaScript libraries like Locomotive Scroll and Swiper JS to create engaging user experiences, including smooth scrolling animations and potentially interactive elements (e.g., sliders, carousels, etc.).


Open to Feedback and Collaboration:

I'm eager to receive your valuable feedback on the design, functionality, and user experience of the prototype. Are there areas for improvement or innovative ideas to integrate? I value your insights and welcome opportunities to collaborate on future projects.Build a Dynamic Agency Website Prototype with Modern Technologies As a coding student passionate about frontend development, I'm thrilled to present my interactive agency website prototype.
